# SolsTiS-Tuning

Stripped down version of the Labview Code used for tuning the SolsTiS M2 Laser with a High Precision wavemeter. This program uses both the built-in SolsTiS tuning for tuning larger than 1 MHz and for high precision steps (<1 MHz) uses the slow and fast resonator analog inputs


Files will need the wavemeter .dll to be executable
